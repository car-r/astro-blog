Sometimes when you're making a component it makes sense to push an element, like a button, to the bottom of a div or card. When using flexbox with a flex direction of column, each element in the div or container will go from top to bottom. In this example, I wanted to pin a button to the bottom of the card.

The easiest way I've found to do this was to utilize flexbox along with a margin-top of auto in order to push the last element to the bottom.

First, make sure to include the flex and flex-col utility classes into the div that contains the rest of the elements. In this case, I have a div with 4 elements as well as another div (wrapped in a Link) that contains the button that I want pushed to the bottom of the card.

I've wrapped the button inside of the Link tag with the utility class of mt-auto which pushes the 'View Post' button to the bottom of the card.

```js
// Card component

<div 
  className='bg-gray-200 bg-opacity-40 rounded-xl flex flex-col w-11/12 lg:w-80 mx-auto' 
  key={post.id}
>
  <div className='px-4 py-4'>
    <h3 className='text-xl font-bold pb-2'>{post.title}</h3>
    <p className='font-light'>
      <span className='font-bold'>Author:</span>
      {post.author}
    </p>
    <p className='font-light'>
      <span className='font-bold'>Comments:</span>
        {post.num_comments}
    </p>
    <p className='font-light'>
      <span className='font-bold'>UpVote:</span>
        {post.ups}
    </p>
  </div>
  <Link href={post.url} className=''>
    <div className='bg-slate-400 bg-opacity-40 rounded-b-xl text-center mt-auto w-full'>
      <button className='w-full font-bold text-xl py-4'>View Post</button>
    </div>
  </Link>
</div>
```

You can use the rounded-b utility class to match the rounded-xl used in the div that wraps the entire card so that there isn't any overlap.

I'm sure that there are plenty of other ways to do this and accomplish the same thing, but using flexbox with a margin-top of auto on the last item was an easy to implement solution!
