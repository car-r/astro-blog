Hi, I'm Carson. I'm a self-taught software developer from Arizona. I've been learning to code in my free time for the last few years and it's finally starting to click! I've stopped and started, switched programming languages, and thought about quitting multiple times.

I was a tennis instructor in my younger years and thought I would pick up a new skill like coding fairly quickly. I've told dozens of students that they need to hit thousands of tennis balls before the muscle memory starts to kick in. It turns out learning to write code isn't all that different from learning to hit a tennis ball. It takes a lot of repetition!

DevReps is all about using the same methods of learning a sport and applying that to learning to code.
